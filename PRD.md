## Design Direction

The design should feel like a whimsical playground where a sophisticated designer decided to have fun - polished chaos with deliberate craft, playful without being childish, absurd while maintaining elegance, and colorful without being overwhelming.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme with three vibrant, energetic colors that create visual excitement while maintaining harmony - used to distinguish different nonsense modes and create joyful visual variety.

- **Primary Color**: Vibrant Purple (oklch(0.65 0.25 300)) - Communicates creativity, whimsy, and the unexpected; used for main actions
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Electric Cyan (oklch(0.75 0.15 210)) - Represents digital playfulness and modern energy
  - Sunny Yellow (oklch(0.85 0.18 95)) - Brings warmth and optimism to the chaos
- **Accent Color**: Hot Pink (oklch(0.70 0.22 350)) - Eye-catching highlight for CTAs and moments of peak absurdity
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(0.98 0 0)): Purple text (oklch(0.45 0.20 300)) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Soft Lavender oklch(0.95 0.05 300)): Deep Purple (oklch(0.35 0.18 300)) - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Vibrant Purple oklch(0.65 0.25 300)): White (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Electric Cyan oklch(0.75 0.15 210)): Deep Navy (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 10.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Hot Pink oklch(0.70 0.22 350)): White (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Muted (Pale Gray oklch(0.93 0.01 300)): Charcoal (oklch(0.45 0.02 300)) - Ratio 6.5:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should feel modern and friendly with a hint of playfulness - clean sans-serif that maintains readability while allowing for dramatic size and weight variations to emphasize the absurdity.

**Selected Font**: Outfit - A geometric sans-serif with rounded qualities that feels contemporary and approachable without being too casual

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Outfit Bold / 32px / -0.02em letter spacing / 1.1 line height
  - H2 (Section Headers): Outfit SemiBold / 24px / -0.01em letter spacing / 1.2 line height
  - H3 (Nonsense Output): Outfit Medium / 28px / 0 letter spacing / 1.3 line height (varies wildly in actual display)
  - Body (Instructions): Outfit Regular / 16px / 0 letter spacing / 1.6 line height
  - Small (Metadata): Outfit Regular / 14px / 0 letter spacing / 1.5 line height
  - Button: Outfit SemiBold / 16px / 0 letter spacing

## Animations

Animations should embrace exaggerated, bouncy physics that amplify the absurdity - think rubber band snaps, playful bounces, and energetic entrances that make users smile while still feeling polished and intentional.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces the playful, chaotic brand personality - nothing moves in straight lines, everything has overshoot and personality
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: 
  - Primary actions (generate button) get the most dramatic animations with scale and bounce
  - Generated nonsense enters with unpredictable directions and spring physics
  - Saved items cascade in with staggered timing
  - Background elements have subtle floating animations for ambient life
